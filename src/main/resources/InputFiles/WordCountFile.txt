Kafka Streams is a client library for building applications and microservices,
especially, where the input and output data are stored in Apache Kafka Clusters.
Basically, with the benefits of Kafka’s server-side cluster technology, Kafka Streams combines
the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side.
Kafka Stream can be easily embedded in any Java application and integrated with any existing packaging,
deployment and operational tools that users have for their streaming applications because it is a simple and lightweight client library.
There are no external dependencies on systems other than Apache Kafka itself as the internal messaging layer.
In order to enable very fast and efficient stateful operations (windowed joins and aggregations), it supports the fault-tolerant local state.
